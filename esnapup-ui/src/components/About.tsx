            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              Founded in 2020, ESnapup began with a simple idea: to make high-quality software development accessible to businesses of all sizes. What started as a small team of passionate developers has grown into a full-service development agency serving clients across industries.

            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              Throughout our journey, we've remained committed to our core values while continuously adapting to the ever-changing technology landscape. Our experience has taught us that successful software is not just about codeâ€”it's about understanding people, processes, and business goals.
